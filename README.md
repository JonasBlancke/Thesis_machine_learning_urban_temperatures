Used source code for my master's thesis in the Master of Science in Bioscience Engineering: Land, Water and Climate.
The code is grouped into the maps according to structure of the thesis:

1)Preprocessing_features: 
2)Subsampling_and_trainvalidationtest_set:
3)Cluster_analysis:
4)Exploratory_analysis:
5)Hyperparameter_tuning
6)Feature_selection:
7)General_model_validation:
8)Limited_cities_models:
